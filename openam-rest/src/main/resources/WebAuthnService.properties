WebAuthnServiceDescription=WebAuthn Service
attributeName=Profile Storage Attribute
attributeName.help=The user's attribute in which to store WebAuthn profiles.
attributeName.help.txt=A specific field has been generated by Wren:AM to handle these profiles, and in most cases the \
  default value will work without further configuration. However, administrators are free to alter this. The new \
  attribute must be able to handle Strings and be stored directly on the user's profile. LDAP User Attributes \
  (accessible in the Realm -> Data Stores tab of the Administrator console) must also be configured to allow for any \
  new attribute used.
deviceSettingsEncryptionScheme=Device Profile Encryption Scheme
deviceSettingsEncryptionScheme.help=Encryption scheme to use to secure device profiles stored on the server.
deviceSettingsEncryptionScheme.help.txt=If enabled, each device profile is encrypted using a unique random secret key \
  using the given strength of AES encryption in CBC mode with PKCS#5 padding. A HMAC-SHA of the given strength \
  (truncated to half-size) is used to ensure integrity protection and authenticated encryption. The unique random key \
  is encrypted with the given RSA key-pair and stored with the device profile. NB: AES-256 may require installation of \
  JCE Unlimited Strength.
RSAES_AES128CBC_HS256=AES-128/HMAC-SHA-256 with RSA Key Wrapping
RSAES_AES256CBC_HS512=AES-256/HMAC-SHA-512 with RSA Key Wrapping
None=No encryption of device settings.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystore=Encryption Key Store
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystore.help=Key Store to load encryption keys from.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystoreType=Key Store Type
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystoreType.help=Type of KeyStore to load.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystoreType.help.txt=Note: PKCS#11 keystores require hardware support such as a security \
  device or smart card and is not available by default in most JVM installations. See the <a \
  href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html" target="_blank">JDK 8 PKCS#11 \
  Reference Guide</a> for more details.
JKS=Java Key Store (JKS).
JCEKS=Java Cryptography Extension Key Store (JCEKS).
PKCS11=PKCS#11 Hardware Crypto Storage.
PKCS12=PKCS#12 Key Store.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystorePassword=Key Store Password
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystorePassword.help=Password to unlock the keystore. This password will be encrypted.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystoreKeyPairAlias=Key-Pair Alias
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystoreKeyPairAlias.help=Alias of the Certificate/PrivateKey in the keystore to use to \
  encrypt/decrypt device profiles.
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystorePrivateKeyPassword=Private Key Password
deviceSettingsEncryptionKeystorePrivateKeyPassword.help=Password to unlock the private key.
